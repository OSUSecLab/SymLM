# Eponym

Eponym is a framework for predicting function names in stripped binaries through context-sensitive execution-aware code embeddings. It is a novel neural architecture that learns the comprehensive function semantics by jointly modeling the execution behaviors of the calling context and instructions via a novel fusing encoder. The workflow of Eponym is shown in the image below:
